# Facade Screen App
This app shows a facade system developed through point attractors. Iterations can be tested by changing the parameters indicated by the sliders

## Plugins
This app uses only native Grasshopper components

## Source
The app can be accessed trhough this link:https://bimsc22-gerald-apptest.herokuapp.com/examples/Facade_screen_lI/
Through the use of sliders one can create different iterations and download them as a Rhino file

The site is published using a Githubpage in this link:https://github.com/GeraldMandevhana/compute.rhino3d.appserver/edit/main/src/examples/Facade_screen_lI/


## Credits
Facade Screen App is a project of IAAC, Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia developed at Master In Advanced Computation For Architecture & Design in 2021/2022 by student: Gerald Mandevhana, and Faculty: David Andres Leon,and Hesham Shawqy.

## Example
When we have our testing server up and running, you can visit

https://compute-rhino3d-appserver.herokuapp.com/examples/

To see a sample web application that passes three numbers based on slider positions to the AppServer for solving a grasshopper definition. Results are returned to the web page and new mesh visualizations are created.
